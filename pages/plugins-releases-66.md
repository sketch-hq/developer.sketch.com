## Changes

### API v1.0 removal

The legacy scripting API for plugins was long overdue for retirement, so it has finally been removed. From now on, plugins will need to use [v2.0 of the JavaScript API](/reference/api).

All of the features of API v1.0 are present in v2.0, except `api.resourceNamed()`, which can be replaced with `context.plugin.urlForResourceNamed()` or the `resourcePath` method in [`skpm/path`](https://github.com/skpm/path).
